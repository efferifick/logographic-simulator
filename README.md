# README

Websites that are intended for audiences that can read logographic scripts follow different design patterns from websites that are in Latin or Greek alphabets. I always wanted to know how my favourite websites would look like if they followed these design patterns. I can't change everything, but at least I can simulate the use of a logographic alphabet by using this add-on.

# IMPORTANT

This is just a proof of concept now. Will work on the addon later.
